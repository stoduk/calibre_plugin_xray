# Calibre Plugin for X-Ray
This is a plugin for Calibre E-Book software (http://calibre-ebook.com/), intended for owners of Kindle devices.

It will generate the various meta-data files that the Kindle uses for the "X-Ray" feature, as well as the "About This Book" and "About the Author" summaries, and the information that appears when you finish your book.

This helps users migrate from another E-book ecosystem (such as Kobo) to Kindle without havine to repurchase already owned books, or losing out on features that the Kindle can support.

# Status
As it stands this is not fully functional.  X-Ray data can be generated (eg. listing mentions of various characters), but there are issues with the location detection here.  Currently no Author/Start/End meta-data is generated.
