# Calibre Plugin for X-Ray
This is a plugin for Calibre E-Book software (http://calibre-ebook.com/), intended for owners of Kindle devices.

It will generate the various meta-data files that the Kindle uses for the "X-Ray" feature, as well as the "About This Book" and "About the Author" summaries, and the information that appears when you finish your book.

This helps users migrate from another E-book ecosystem (such as Kobo) to Kindle without havine to repurchase already owned books, or losing out on features that the Kindle can support.

# Status
As it stands this is not fully functional.  X-Ray data can be generated (eg. listing mentions of various characters), but there are issues with the location detection here.  Currently no Author/Start/End meta-data is generated.

# Usage
The latest version of the plugin is available on the Calibre forums.  You could zip up the contents of this file and ask Calibre to install it, but unless you are keen it would be better to wait for the next released version at least.
